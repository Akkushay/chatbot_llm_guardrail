Project Modules
===============

This section provides an API reference for the key modules in the Chatbot LLM Guardrail project, along with a brief description of each moduleâ€™s responsibilities.

Data Modules
------------
The Data Module is responsible for synthetic data generation. It includes functionality to generate synthetic samples for banking products, which are used for training and evaluation.

Model Modules
-------------
The Model Module contains the code for model training and preprocessing. It handles tasks such as loading datasets, oversampling to balance classes, tokenizing inputs, and fine-tuning the model using LoRa. It also includes a custom trainer class that extends the Hugging Face Trainer.

Evaluation Modules
------------------
The Evaluation Module provides the core logic to assess the quality of chatbot responses. It features a guardrail that combines a LoRa-based classifier with a few-shot LLM prompt for detailed evaluation, and an evaluator class that can process single or bulk evaluations.

App Modules
-----------
The App Module contains the Streamlit application which offers an interactive interface to test individual responses and perform bulk evaluations. It integrates the evaluation components with user-friendly visualizations.
